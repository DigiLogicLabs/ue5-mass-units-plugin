- **Technical Challenges**: Mitigate through time buffers and alternative approaches
- **Resource Availability**: Mitigate through cross-training and documentation

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The plugin can render and simulate at least 10,000 units at 60 FPS on high-end hardware
2. Seamless integration with GASCompanion is achieved
3. Units transition smoothly between vertex and skeletal animation
4. Formation and navigation systems work efficiently
5. The plugin is compatible with procedural environments and roguelike elements
6. Documentation and examples are comprehensive and clear
7. The plugin can be easily integrated into existing projects

## Conclusion
