# Mass Unit System Plugin: Build and Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for building the Mass Unit System plugin and implementing it in your Unreal Engine 5.5 project. The plugin enables large-scale unit simulation with Gameplay Ability System (GAS) integration, making it ideal for games with massive enemy swarms.

## Building the Plugin

### Prerequisites

- Unreal Engine 5.5 or later installed
- Visual Studio 2022 or later with C++ support
- Basic knowledge of Unreal Engine plugin development

### Build Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Plugin**:
   - Place the plugin in your project's `Plugins` directory or in the engine's `Plugins` directory for engine-wide installation

2. **Configure the Build Script**:
   - Open `build_plugin.bat` in the plugin root directory
   - Update the `UE_PATH` variable to point to your Unreal Engine installation
   - Save the file

3. **Run the Build Script**:
   - Double-click `build_plugin.bat` or run it from the command line
   - Wait for the build process to complete
   - Verify that the build completed successfully

4. **Alternative Build Method**:
   - Open your project in Unreal Engine
   - Enable the plugin via Edit > Plugins
   - The engine will automatically compile the plugin when needed

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

- **Missing Dependencies**:
  - Ensure all required plugins are enabled:
    - Mass Entity
    - Mass Gameplay
    - Niagara
    - Gameplay Abilities
    - GASCompanion

- **Compilation Errors**:
  - Check the build log for specific error messages
  - Verify that your Unreal Engine version is 5.5 or later
  - Ensure your C++ compiler is compatible with UE5.5

## Plugin Implementation

### Adding to Your Project

1. **Enable the Plugin**:
   - Open your project in Unreal Engine
   - Go to Edit > Plugins
   - Find "Mass Unit System" in the Gameplay category
   - Check the Enabled checkbox
   - Restart the editor when prompted

2. **Configure Project Settings**:
   - Set up navigation settings for units
   - Configure collision profiles
   - Set up input mappings for unit control

### Creating Unit Templates

1. **Create Unit Template Assets**:
   - In the Content Browser, right-click and select Create > Mass Unit System > Unit Template
   - Create templates for different unit types (Infantry, Archers, Cavalry, etc.)

2. **Configure Unit Properties**:
   - Set unit type tags
   - Configure base attributes
   - Assign visual assets (meshes, textures)
   - Set up team and faction information

### Setting Up the Formation System

1. **Access the Formation System**:
   - Get the Mass Unit Subsystem from your game instance
   - Access the Formation System through the subsystem

2. **Create Formations**:
   - Use `CreateFormation()` to create new formations
   - Specify formation type, location, and rotation

3. **Add Units to Formations**:
   - Use `AddEntityToFormation()` to add units to formations
   - Set formation targets with `SetFormationTarget()`

### Implementing GAS Integration

1. **Create Ability Sets**:
   - Use GASCompanion to create ability sets for units
   - Define abilities for different unit types

2. **Set Up Attribute Sets**:
   - Create attribute sets for units
   - Configure base attributes in unit templates

3. **Connect GAS to Units**:
   - Use the GAS integration components provided by the plugin
   - Configure ability activation through the unit system

## Sample Implementation
