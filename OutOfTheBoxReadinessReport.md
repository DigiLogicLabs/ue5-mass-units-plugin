# Out-of-the-Box Readiness Report

Audit baseline: plugin version 1.1.0, Unreal Engine 5.7.2, Win64.

## Result

The plugin now compiles, packages, starts, creates independent native Mass entities, simulates its core lifecycle, renders without plugin content, and shuts down safely in an otherwise empty host project.

"Out of the box" means core unit creation, lightweight movement/combat, formation membership, direct or navmesh routing, and a visible instanced representation require no third-party plugin and no bundled art asset. Optional GAS, Behavior Tree, Niagara, skeletal, and VAT workflows still require project-owned assets or objects by design.

## Critical issues corrected

- Removed the fallback manager whose fragments were process-wide statics shared by every unit.
- Replaced no-op processor execution with native Mass chunk queries.
- Removed public compatibility headers that could shadow Unreal's `MassCommonFragments.h` and `MassCommonTypes.h`.
- Replaced the invalid Game Instance subsystem/world dependency with a tickable world subsystem.
- Fixed malformed GAS source and made ASC ownership explicit and opt-in.
- Fixed async navigation ownership so callbacks update the requesting entity.
- Replaced a hardcoded missing Niagara asset with configurable Niagara plus HISM fallback.
- Added the mesh fields used by visual code and implemented a bounded skeletal component pool.
- Removed unused `MassAI` and nonexistent/obsolete `GASCompanion` requirements.
- Made shutdown independent of Mass subsystem deinitialization order.

## Verification performed

UAT `BuildPlugin` completed successfully with warnings-as-errors header generation for:

- UnrealEditor Win64 Development
- UnrealGame Win64 Development
- UnrealGame Win64 Shipping

The editor automation test `MassUnitSystem.Core.NativeMassLifecycle` completed with:

- 1 succeeded
- 0 succeeded with warnings
- 0 failed
- 0 test warnings or errors

The test verifies two distinct native handles and transforms, team-based combat damage, direct navigation fallback, isolated movement fragments, formation add/remove, explicit entity destruction, and world teardown.

## Distribution checks

- Descriptor JSON parses and declares only engine plugins actually required.
- Source descriptor has no machine-specific `EngineVersion` pin.
- Runtime/editor module rules compile in packaged non-unity contexts.
- Windows and Unix build helpers accept an engine root and package outside source `Binaries`.
- The main setup, usage, API, architecture, troubleshooting, and changelog documents match the implementation.

## Intentional boundaries

- No production Niagara, mesh, material, VAT, behavior-tree, ability, or effect assets are included.
- GAS and Behavior Trees are selective bridges, not per-entity defaults.
- Multiplayer replication is project-specific.
- The default unit cap is not a performance claim; profile representative content and hardware.
- UE 5.7.2 is the verified engine baseline. Other minor engine versions require their own compile and runtime pass.

## Release recommendation

The core plugin is suitable for integration testing and upstream review as a functional native Mass foundation. Before calling it production-ready for a specific game, add project content, multiplayer requirements, soak/performance tests, and CI coverage for every supported engine/platform combination.
