# Optimization Techniques for Large-Scale Unit Simulations

## Overview
This document outlines key optimization techniques for large-scale unit simulations in Unreal Engine 5.5. These techniques are essential for achieving high performance when rendering and simulating thousands of units simultaneously.

## Data-Oriented Design

### Entity Component System (ECS)
- **Mass Entity System**: UE5's data-oriented framework designed for high-performance simulation
- **Archetype-Based Organization**: Groups similar entities for efficient memory access
- **Batch Processing**: Process entities in batches rather than individually
- **Cache Coherency**: Organize data to maximize CPU cache utilization

### Memory Management
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse objects instead of creating/destroying them
- **Memory Arenas**: Allocate memory in blocks to reduce fragmentation
- **Custom Allocators**: Implement specialized allocators for different entity types
- **Shared Resources**: Share data between similar entities to reduce memory usage

## Rendering Optimizations

### Level of Detail (LOD)
- **Distance-Based LOD**: Reduce detail for distant units
- **Behavior LOD**: Simplify AI and physics for distant units
- **Animation LOD**: Use simpler animations for distant units
- **Update Frequency LOD**: Update distant units less frequently

### Instanced Rendering
- **GPU Instancing**: Render multiple instances of the same mesh with a single draw call
- **Hierarchical Instancing**: Group instances by material and mesh
- **Instance Culling**: Cull instances based on visibility

### Batched Processing
- **Command Buffers**: Batch commands for efficient execution
- **Deferred Operations**: Collect operations and execute them in batches

## Network Optimizations

### Data Compression
- **Delta Compression**: Send only changes in state
- **Quantization**: Reduce precision for network transmission
- **Prioritized Updates**: Prioritize important state changes
- **Relevancy Filtering**: Send updates only to relevant clients

### Prediction and Interpolation
- **Client-Side Prediction**: Predict movement on clients
- **Server Reconciliation**: Correct client predictions when needed
- **Entity Interpolation**: Smooth movement between updates
- **Extrapolation**: Predict future positions based on current velocity

### Interest Management
- **Area of Interest**: Only replicate entities within client's area of interest
- **Dynamic Interest**: Adjust interest area based on gameplay
- **Visibility-Based Replication**: Only replicate visible entities
- **Priority-Based Replication**: Prioritize important entities

## Physics Optimizations

### Simplified Physics
- **Simplified Collision**: Use simple collision shapes
- **Physics LOD**: Reduce physics complexity for distant units
- **Group Physics**: Treat groups as a single entity for physics

### Collision Optimization
- **Collision Filtering**: Only check collisions between relevant entities
- **Broad Phase Optimization**: Efficiently find potential collision pairs
- **Continuous Collision Detection**: Prevent tunneling for fast-moving objects
- **Collision Caching**: Cache collision results for similar entities
